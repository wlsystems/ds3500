In Part 2 of the Sprite Editor assignment, you will implement your requirements into a working program, to be shown off during the Nov. 8th class. Here are some artifacts you must produce for this assignment:

A working sprite editor. Development on the editor should be done using a course github account. Invitations to an assignment repository are at 
https://classroom.github.com/a/IbvWFZTJ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.
There are 2 code release dates.
A beta release is due Nov. 9th. I will provide more information about this, but essentially other people will try your application and give some feedback during class.
On the Nov. 14th due date, your final code must be uploaded to the repository. A cloned project should build with a Qt 5.9.1 install. You may specify an OS architecture that it works on with a README file. This is really only important for external libraries (such as for gif export). External libraries should be built for the specified architecture and installed in a repository subdirectory (with the include files) and added to the Qt project file so that cloning and building will succeed on the target machine architecture. An example will be done soon of adding external libraries.
A code style document. This must be ready by the Nov. 8th lab session. This style document should cover what your identifiers look like (variables, class names, methods), indenting, whitespace, and comment requirements. This should fit on a single page. Make your code follow your style document. You can look at something like the Google C++ style guide, but it covers a lot of C++ feature usage. I am more interested in the visual appearance of your code. (if you get sucked into the Google style guide, also read https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140503193653-3046051-why-google-style-guide-for-c-is-a-deal-breaker (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. as a counterpoint). Besides having coders follow the style guide, each source file should be checked by a different person than the ones who wrote it for style guide violations. At the end of the style guide document, for final submission, add a listing of source files and the name of the person responsible for each file. Each member of the team must have at least one file they check.
A user guide that presents a tutorial style document for using your system (a few pages with images).
A short presentation on your product (most of which is likely a live demo). It must be 5 minutes or less. You do not need to submit anything for this part. This will be presented on Nov. 14th during class. Time is short. You will be cut off after 5 minutes. You need to test out the AV aspects of your presentation in advance.
An example sprite produced by your system saved in the project format.
A short video showing your editor in action. On macs, Quicktime can do screen capture and makes small mp4 files. On Windows, there are more options. These should make reasonably-sized videos. You can make a youtube upload and provide a link or something similar if you do not want to submit the actual file.
Each team member must submit a self and team evaluation halfway through and at the end of the implementation phase. We will be using Google forms. I will send out links.
You will spend some lab time meeting as a group with TAs to go over progress.
Submit a zipped folder with these documents and the location of the code repository. The main folder should have some short but recognizable version of your team name. 

The project will be evaluated on (in roughly descending order of importance):

The project quality and features
Your project presentation
Your individual contributions
Project materials
Your evaluation by TAs and teammates 
Meeting the goals of the planning phase
